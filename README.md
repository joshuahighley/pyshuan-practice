# pyshuan-practice
Learning myself python, one little project at a time. There's a little javascript in there, but if there's going to be more I'll probably make a new repository. 

Who knows, maybe I'll get into p5.js?

Some Goals:
- Automate the boring stuff (e.g. time sheets). This is a direct reference to the book & course, which is what I used to get started.
- See if Data Analysis or engineering is an interesting career path.

Some Projects:
- timeSheetFiller
- Letterboxd Analysis
